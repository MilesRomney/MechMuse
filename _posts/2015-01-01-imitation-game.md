Saw Imitation Game last night. It's about Alan Turing cracking the Nazi Enigma encryption machine during WWII. Excellent, excellent movie; one of 2014's best.

It also would have been a _highly_ effective propaganda film (I say that with the greatest respect) . . . if the filmmakers hadn't revealed it as such in its final 15 seconds. Subtlety is a lost art, it seems.
