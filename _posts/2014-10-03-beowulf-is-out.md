Ah-ha-ha! I'm holding the first printing of _Beowulf: A Bloody Calculus_ IN MY HANDS. Beautiful printing. very excited. The trade paperback was released today (the e-book was out a few weeks ago for inclusion in StoryBundle.)

If you're in SLC, pick it up at the King's English Bookshop, in Sugarhouse. Otherwise, you can order it through B&N, or get it from Amazon or from the East India Press website (free shipping):

It's a near-future sci-fi thriller. The reviews are great:

"The most exciting cyberpunk debut in 20 years."

"Reminds me of my first experience with hospital-grade nitrous oxide."

"From page one, it was obvious that this is a rare and unique talent. . . . oh, and did I mention it's EXCITING?"

"A true pleasure."

"Loved it."

Yes!
