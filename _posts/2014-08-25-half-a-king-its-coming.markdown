It's a little disconcerting to see nearly all of my favorite "gritty" genre writers dive into YA. But the results, in most cases, have been quite good.  I'm looking forward to *Half a King*.

(I heard Paolo Bacigalupi talking about his inspirations for *Zombie Baseball Beatdown* at WorldCon last year. "F&#k kid, I'll write you a zomebie book.")
